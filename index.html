        <p>Finally! <i>Effective Computation in Physics</i> is a manual for
        starting up or honing your programming and software skills even though
        your background is in the physical sciences or engineering. This book
        is <i>your</i> field guide to computing and research in the context
        of the work that you are already doing. We cover all of the big
        topics that you'll need, from how to program in
        <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, how to use
        important Python third party libraries such as
        <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> and
        <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>,
        how to interact with the command line, how to write quality
        publications using <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>,
        and we even dive into the social aspects
        of science and software development by teaching you
        <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>This book is aimed at people from all physics-based fields.
        We take this to mean physics, astronomy, astrophysics, geology,
        geophysics, climate science, applied math, biophysics, nuclear
        engineering, mechanical engineering, material science, electrical
        engineering, and more!
        </p>
        <p>All too often in the physical sciences, people are asked and
        expected to "just pick up" the computational aspects of their work
        as they go. This may have been a reasonable expectation in decades
        past. But now there is so much going on in computer science
        and software development that it is impossible to keep up, let alone
        get ahead. As both authors have run this gauntlet and survived,
        we understand the perspective and challenges of physical scientists
        and engineers who are starting out in computing - no matter what point
        they are at in their career. <i>Effective Computation in Physics</i>
        will give you the computational foundation that you need to
        succeed in your work.

      <article id="content">
        <header>
          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <p>Please follow the instructions below to set up your computer.</p>
        </header>
        <p>To follow along with the code examples and work on the exercies
        in <i>Effective Computation in Physics</i>, you'll first need to
        install some software. Everything that you need is
        <a href="http://opensource.org/definition">free and open source</a>.
        We will be using the <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/">conda</a>
        package manager for all of our installation needs.</p>

        <a name="install-step1"></a>
        <h3>Step 1: Download & Install Miniconda</h3>
        <p>If you have not done so already, please download and install
        miniconda. Miniconda is Python distribution that comes with conda,
        which we will then use to install everything else we need.
        To download miniconda, please visit
        <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html">http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html</a>
        and find the version that is right for your system. Linux, Mac OSX,
        and Windows builds are available for 32- and 64-bit architectures.
        You do not need administrator privileges on your computer to
        install miniconda. We recommend that you install the Python 3
        version of miniconda. All of the examples in this book should
        work with Python 2 as well.</p>

        <p>If you are on Windows, you can install miniconda simply by
        double clicking on the executable and following the
        instructions on the installation wizard.</p>

        <p style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;">
        <u><b>Special Windows Instructions - msysGit and Git Bash:</b></u>
        If you are on Windows, please download and install msysGit,
        which you can find at
        <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">http://msysgit.github.io/</a>.
        This will provide you with both the version control system called
        git as well as the bash shell. Both of these we will discuss at
        length and are not automatically available on Windows or through
        miniconda. The default install settings should be good enough for
        purposes here.</p>

        <p>If you are on Linux or Mac OSX, first open your <code>Terminal</code>
        application. If you do not know where your terminal lives, uses
        your operating system's search functionality to find it.  Once you
        have an open terminal, type in the following after the dollar sign
        ($).  Note that you may have to change the version number in the
        filename (the Miniconda-3.7.0-Linux-x86_64.sh part) to match the file
        that you downloaded.</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/scopatz/15e6a3d66cb1109cade8.js">
        </script>
        <!--
        # On Linux, Use the following to install Miniconda:
        $ bash ~/Downloads/Miniconda-3.7.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

        # On MacOSX, Use the following to install Miniconda:
        $ bash ~/Downloads/Miniconda3-3.7.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
        -->

        <p>In the above we have downloaded miniconda into our default download
        directory, <code>~/Downloads</code>.  The name of the file that we
        downloaded also depends on the version of miniconda that we grabbed
        as well as whether it was 32- or 64-bit. You may have to adjust the
        file name accordingly.</p>

        <p>On all Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows, when the installer asks you
        if you would like to automatically change or update the
        <code>bashrc</code> file or the system <code>PATH</code>, say yes.
        That will make it so that miniconda is automatically in your
        environment and will ease further installation. Otherwise, all of
        the other default installation options should be good enough.</p>

        <a name="install-step2"></a>
        <h3>Step 2: Install the Packages</h3>
        <p>Now that you have conda installed, we can install the packages
        that we need for this book.  On Windows open up the command prompt,
        <code>cmd.exe</code>. On Linux and Mac OSX, open up a terminal.
        You may need to open up a new terminal window for the installation of
        minconda to take effect. Now, no matter what your operating system is,
        type the following command:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/scopatz/18c66ba6ff4918468169.js">
        </script>
        <!--
        # On Linux, Use the following to install Miniconda:
        $ conda install --yes numpy scipy ipython ipython-notebook matplotlib pandas \
          pytables nose setuptools sphinx mpi4py
        -->

        <p>This may take a few minutes to download. After this, you are
        ready to go!</p>
